# audiostego
Using the phase coding technique to apply the discrete fourier transform to breakup the audio file in the amplitudes of different frequencies and then bring changes to the  amplitude of certain frequencies which is inaudible to the human ear and encode the message on the signal in binary and recombine the all the frequencies back together and then perform and inverse fourier transform to create the steganographic audio file.
